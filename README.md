# ⚽ EPL 2025–26 Football Analytics

A complete football analytics project built using **MySQL, Python, and Power BI** to analyze the English Premier League 2025–26 season.

The project transforms raw match data into meaningful insights through SQL queries, statistical analysis, and interactive dashboards.

---

## 📖 Project Overview

Football generates thousands of match statistics every season. This project explores those statistics to answer questions such as:

- Which teams performed best at home and away?
- Which clubs were the most efficient in front of goal?
- How much home advantage existed throughout the season?
- Which referees issued the most cards?
- How disciplined were teams?
- Do clean sheets or disciplinary records relate to league position?

The project combines database querying, statistical testing, and data visualization into a complete analytics workflow.
